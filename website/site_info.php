<OL><b>Site Info: Crap worth reading probably once.</b>
<li>User E-Mail
	<ul>
		<li>Users are REQUIRED to have a valid e-mail address on file.</li>
		<li>This address is never posted or listed on the site.</li>
		<li>The Admin is the only one with access.</li>
		<li>There will be no automated e-mailer that contacts you unless one is Explicitly Signed Up For.</li>
		<li>Spam sucks. I hate it too.  I will not spam you.  If I am sending you an e-mail, there is a Reason behind it.</li>
	</ul>
<li>File Formats
	<ul>
		<li>Currently we support GIF, JPEG, PNG for image formats.</li>
		<li>*coming soon* Text formats are limited currently to .TXT and .RTF And by .txt we mean "Unformatted plain vanilla, open it up in anything at all"</li>
		<li>If you would like a file format supported, please let me know.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Moderators
	<ul>
		<li>Yes, there will be moderators.</li>
		<li>I, the Admin, have the final say on who can be a Moderator.  I will of course listen to objections.</li>
		<li>Moderators, when speaking AS a moderator, will be visually different.</li>
		<li>Yes, all moderator actions are tracked and audited.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li>Donations/Ad Banners/Premium Membership
	<ul>
		<li>Donations go to the running of the site. I will do my best to make the cost-per-month available.</li>
		<li>Premium Members receive Extra features only.  Premium Members are still bound to All The Rules.</li>
		<li>A Premium Member may choose to have "flair" signifying such.</li>
		<li>There is no -required- membership fee.  Just because we have 'premium' doesn't mean a thing.  Hell, I might scrap it if there are enough donations.</li>
		<li>Ads are to pay the bills.  I would like for this site to be able to pay for itself.  Donations would be ideal.</li>
