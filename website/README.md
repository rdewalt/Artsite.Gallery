Other Ideas
----------
I could set up a Patreon as Site Support.
$2: basic supporter, get a "Supporter" flair?
$5: Silver Supporter, get a different color flair, and suggestions/voting on Next Feature.
$10: Gold Supporter, Same as $5, but more.
$20: Diamond Supporter, 
$50: Unobtanium Supporter,
$100: [Classified] Supporter, 

Serial Link Images (stories)

Premium Features: (-- for someone who sends a monthly $ or is sponsored)
(( I may or may not even do a "Premium" version, but the site needs to be self-supporting. This is just one way.))
 Subscriber Flair
 10% off Ad Banner Bits?
 Turn off Ads

Podcast: -  Do a monthly podcast with an artist/artists ?
	Initial discussion with them over Skype, pre-record and edit together later.
	Common Questions?  a "Ten Questions: "  Meant for a rapid-fire

Ads?  - Ads can _suck_  , but I need to pay for the site somehow.
 Semi-self-service
 ads should load from ads.yart.me so people can adblock if they must.  I will put up a simple "Adblocking? Ok, I understand.."
 .gif, .jpg or .png only.  I don't want to deal with Flash Ads.
 $5 for 30 days.
 	Ads must be approved,  Will be approved within 24 hours.
 		IF not approved in 24 hours, you get an extra week per 24 hours oopsed.
 ADULT ads will only be visible in NSFW mode.
 Your ad goes into the loop, if there are 100 ads, then you get every 100th view.
 YOU MUST have an account on the site.  ONE ad per account.
