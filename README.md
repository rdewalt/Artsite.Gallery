# ReturnOfYNA

Here's the thing.   Part of me is "hey, don't release it, this is something you've worked hard on."  And then part of me is also saying "Hey, you've used open source projects for ages, why not post this and let others benefit.

So thats where this is.


# SO, you want to set up your own?
You will need to have enough skill in AWS to setup:

IAM User for terraform to work against.  

Enough to set up The Cognito User Pool and all it entails to get working.  

Route 53 + Have a Domain in a hosted zone to use.  

SSH skills enough to set up a ssh config for using a bastion.  

Skill to modify my shitty PHP to fit your settings.  


You will need to know git enough to setup the Secrets in case you want to use the CI/CD pipeline I have setup.
