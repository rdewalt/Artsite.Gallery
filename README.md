You will need to have enough skill in AWS to setup:

IAM User for terraform to work against.
Enough to set up The Cognito User Pool and all it entails to get working.
Route 53 + Have a Domain in a hosted zone to use.
SSH skills enough to set up a ssh config for using a bastion.
Skill to modify my shitty PHP to fit your settings.
